> I love this bot for all of its useful commands. It's got guides for everything, trade prices, and so much more. Back when it had blackjack  assist, it was the most unique bot on Discord, and even with it gone, still remains one of the best. This bot is highly recommended by  yours truly if you are looking to start your own Dank Memer community, or just want to compliment Dank Memer in your existing server.

> An all around amazing bot. The dev team is super nice and open to suggestions and constantly working on improving the user experience. The reminders are super useful for grinding and there’s tons of informational guides that help make grinding more efficient. In my opinion, this bot is a must have for any Dank Memer server.
